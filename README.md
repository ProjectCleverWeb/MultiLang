##Languages

####Directly Supported Languages:
These languages have specific rules in the scheme to allow better syntax highlighting, and often are schemed to be distinguishable in mixed code.

* HTML, XML, CSS, PHP, Markdown, JSON

[↑Table of Contents↑](#table-of-contents)

####Non-Directly Supported Languages:
These languages are supported well (though possibly not as well as others) through the default interpretation settings, but have little or no specific rules in the scheme.

* Shell, CoffeeScript, Ruby, Clojure

[↑Table of Contents↑](#table-of-contents)

####Partially Supported Languages:
These languages have at least some support, but need to be [Directly Supported](#directly-supported-languages) in order to be considered completely supported.

* LESS, SASS/SCSS, Javascript, Python, ActionScript, C, C#, C++, Haskell, ColdFusion, YAML

[↑Table of Contents↑](#table-of-contents)

####Work-in-progress Languages:
These languages have been scheduled to be added to the [Directly Supported](#directly-supported-languages) list.

* LESS, SASS/SCSS, JavaScript, YAML

[↑Table of Contents↑](#table-of-contents)

####Community Work-in-progress Languages:
These are languages I do not know well enough to scheme myself, and will need the community (that's you) to send pull requests in order to have them added to the [Directly](#directly-supported-languages)/[Non-Directly](#non-directly-supported-languages) Supported lists.

* ColdFusion, Python, Ruby, ActionScript, C, C#, C++, Haskell, **all others**

##FAQ's

* Do these schemes work with Sublime Text 3?
    * **Yes.**
* Will there ever be a light/white version of these themes?
    * **Yes. At the moment, we don't have the light version where we want it quite yet so it hasn't been released. In the future we will also have color variations of the white, including Pink, Orange and Blue versions**
* I don't like the way &lt;insert language&gt; is colored, can you change it to something like &lt;insert other language&gt;?
    * **No, colors for all languages are chosen based on how they look next to other languages they are commonly found with, and not by "favorite" colors.**
* Why is &lt;insert programming language&gt; not being highlighted?
    * **Sublime Text doesn't support all languages by default, so some languages may require you to install a plugin (aka package) in order for them to be highlighted.**
* Can I make my own version of this project?
    * **Yes, but only under the terms of the license.**
* Can I contribute to this project?
    * **Yes, see the section marked "[Contributing](#contributing)."**
